# About

The purpose of this project is to implement a simple XMPP client that is capable of sending and receiving messages, files and updates from users and contacts. The project was made using Python3.8.10 and the `sliXMPP` library.

### Project Functionalities
- [ ] Register a new account
- [ ] Log in with an existing account
- [ ] Log out of a current session
- [ ] Delete account from server
- [ ] Retreive user's contact list
- [ ] Show user details
- [ ] 1 on 1 chat
- [ ] Group Chat
- [ ] Send Presence Stanzas
- [ ] Send/Receive Files

## Difficulties
The main difficulty in developing this project was definetively the lack of documentation on `sliXMPP`'s website. It made the whole process longer.

## Lessons Learned
- I learned how to implement a client that follows a generally known protocol.
- How to handle asynchronous events in python.

# Requirements

This project requires no modules outside of Python3.x and sliXMPP.

# Configuration

To install dependencies, run
```
pip3 install sliXMPP
